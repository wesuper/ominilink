# Example javaseeker-projects.yml
# This file defines the Java projects that the JavaSeeker service can analyze.
# It is dynamically monitored for changes, allowing projects to be added,
# removed, or modified without restarting the service.

projects:
  - name: "example-spring-petclinic"
    # sourceType: "git" or "local"
    sourceType: "git"
    # location: Repository URL for "git", or absolute/relative file path for "local"
    location: "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git"
    # branch: (Optional) Specify a branch for "git" sources. Defaults to the repository's default branch (e.g., main or master).
    branch: "main"
    # localCachePath: Absolute or relative path to cache the project.
    # If relative, it's resolved against the application's working directory.
    # If omitted, defaults to "./.cache/<project-name>"
    localCachePath: ".cache/spring-petclinic"
    # status: Managed internally by the service. Initial value is typically NOT_SYNCED.
    # Possible statuses: NOT_SYNCED, SYNCING, FAILED_SYNC, COMPILING, FAILED_BUILD, READY, FAILED_INVALID_PATH, READY_NO_BUILD_FILE
    status: "NOT_SYNCED"

  - name: "example-local-project"
    sourceType: "local"
    # For local projects, 'location' should be the path to the project directory.
    # Ensure this path exists and contains a valid Java project (Maven or Gradle).
    # Replace with an actual path to a local project on your system for testing.
    location: "/tmp/my-local-java-project" # PLEASE REPLACE WITH A VALID LOCAL PATH FOR TESTING
    # localCachePath is typically the same as 'location' for 'local' type, or can be omitted if location is absolute.
    # If location is relative, localCachePath helps define an absolute anchor if needed,
    # but usually, for 'local' type, 'location' itself is the direct source.
    # For simplicity, if 'localCachePath' is omitted for 'local' type, 'location' is used directly.
    # The ProjectConfigurationManager will ensure it's an absolute path.
    # localCachePath: "/tmp/my-local-java-project" # Can be omitted if 'location' is absolute
    status: "NOT_SYNCED"

  # - name: "another-git-project"
  #   sourceType: "git"
  #   location: "https://github.com/user/another-repo.git"
  #   branch: "develop"
  #   localCachePath: ".cache/another-repo" # Will be stored in <app-workdir>/.cache/another-repo
  #   status: "NOT_SYNCED"
